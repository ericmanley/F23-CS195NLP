    "\n",
    "You will accumulate Experience Points (xp) as you complete this course. On each demo day, you can earn xp for three different categories of items:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Core Practice:** 5xp per Fortnight. This is earned for running all sample code given in workshop presentations and keeping your own notes on it (in Markdown cells in the Jupyter Notebooks). You do not need to demo this to earn credit unless it is the only thing you are getting xp for in that Fortnight.\n",
    "2. **Applied Exploration:** 5xp per Fortnight. For each Fortnight, you can get this xp for completing exercises that apply the sample code in new ways. Usually, this will mean doing the same kinds of things in the sample code but with different models or data and writing a short evaluation of what you found in a Markdown cell. Instructions for how to earn this credit will be given with most workshop presentations, but it should typically represent at least a few hours of work outside of class for each Fortnight. You will typically start each of the Applied Explorations in class, but for the credit, you will need to complete at least one of them in detail with all of the requested notes, answers to questions, etc.\n",
    "3. **Creative Synthesis:** Unlimited xp available. This is earned for creative projects which involve substantially original code or writing. Defining the project itself is part of the work, but here are some guidelines. In addition to demoing these for your group, you should get the instructor's thumbs up to be sure you earned the xp (I may ask for revisions/additions before signing off on it). You may also negotiate with the instructor for other ideas you have.\n",
    "    * **Small project prototype:** 5xp. Create a prototype for a software application which uses ideas from the course (no set standard for \"size\", but I'm thinking about 100 lines of code or 5-10 hours of work)\n",
    "    * **Large project prototype:** 20xp. This is an application with more code and more polish than a small project. I would expect this to take at least 20 hours of work, and it can span multiple fortnights.\n",
    "    * **Extended implementation:** 5xp. Take the ideas from workshop presentation, *use additional resources*, and take it farther - implement new variations of an algorithm, use additional options/parameters, try things with different libraries, etc.\n",
    "    * **Write a tutorial:** 5xp. Write up a tutorial with original writing (citing any sources) explaining concepts or showing how to use tools/modules/libraries related to the course. Here are some examples of articles in this genre (but for non-NLP topics) - you can find many more on sites like these:\n",

    "        - https://pyimagesearch.com/2021/11/08/u-net-training-image-segmentation-models-in-pytorch/\n",
    "    * **Run a workshop:** 10xp - *subject to instructor approval and must be arranged in advance*. Pick a new topic that we haven't scheduled or haven't covered yet, and run a workshop for that day. It should include a mini-presentation and some work for students to do. \n",
    "    * **Team work:** 2xp. Earn these *additional* points on one of the above creative synthesis items that you worked on in collaboration with one or more other students. All team members should do enough individual work to meet the requirements on their own, and you must document individual work in your portfolio, but you will be rewarded for coordinating it in a teamwork setting.\n",
    "    * **Topic integration:** 2xp. Earn these *additional* points on one of the above creative synthesis items that includes substantial combination of two or more different course topics (or a course topic and another topic outside the scope of the class - an NLP topic we didn't cover, something from another course, etc.), integrated into one cohesive deliverable."
